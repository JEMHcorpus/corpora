This is a subdirectory of the JEMH corpora repository. It includes works from The Ben-Yehuda Project (http://benyehuda.org/) that are within the public domain, with annotations provided by the JEMH project. 

The collection is divided into subdirectories according to date of creation, with all works from a given decade placed under the same subdirectory. Individual works are encoded in the TEI format. At this stage, only metadata is enocded. Markup and annotation of the texts themselves will be added in future editions.
